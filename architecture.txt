Architecture Overview

S3 File Upload Notification System

This project implements an event driven AWS architecture that automatically sends notifications when a file is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. The design uses serverless services to ensure scalability, reliability, and minimal operational overhead.


Architecture Components

Amazon S3
Amazon S3 is used as the storage layer for uploaded files.
Users upload objects such as documents, images, or logs into a designated S3 bucket.
The bucket is configured to generate event notifications for object creation events.

Role in architecture
Stores uploaded files
Acts as the event source
Triggers downstream processing


S3 Event Notification
The S3 bucket is configured with an event notification rule.
The rule listens for ObjectCreated events such as PutObject or CompleteMultipartUpload.
When a new file is uploaded, S3 automatically sends an event to AWS Lambda.

Role in architecture
Detects file upload events
Initiates the serverless workflow
Eliminates the need for manual polling


AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is used to process S3 events without provisioning servers.
The Lambda function is triggered automatically by S3 events.
It extracts metadata such as bucket name and object key from the event payload.

Role in architecture
Processes S3 event data
Extracts file metadata
Formats notification messages
Acts as the core business logic layer

Lambda behavior
Validates incoming event structure
Handles only S3 event sources
Logs execution details to CloudWatch


Amazon SNS
Amazon Simple Notification Service is used to send email notifications.
The Lambda function publishes messages to an SNS topic.
SNS delivers the notification to subscribed email endpoints.

Role in architecture
Decouples notification logic from processing logic
Sends real time alerts
Supports multiple subscribers


Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch is used for logging and monitoring.
Lambda automatically writes execution logs to CloudWatch Log Groups.
These logs help with debugging, auditing, and operational visibility.

Role in architecture
Stores Lambda execution logs
Tracks invocation success and failures
Assists in troubleshooting issues


Architecture Flow

User uploads a file to the S3 bucket
S3 detects the object creation event
S3 triggers the Lambda function
Lambda processes the event and extracts file details
Lambda publishes a message to the SNS topic
SNS sends an email notification to subscribed users
CloudWatch logs the Lambda execution


Security Design

IAM Role is attached to Lambda with least privilege access
Lambda role permissions include
Read access to S3 event metadata
Publish permission to SNS topic
Write access to CloudWatch Logs
Public access to S3 bucket is not required


Scalability and Reliability

Architecture is fully serverless
Automatically scales with number of file uploads
No servers to manage or maintain
High availability ensured by AWS managed services


Cost Optimization
Lambda runs only on events
SNS charges only per notification
S3 event notifications are free
CloudWatch logs kept minimal
Suitable for AWS Free Trial usage


Use Cases

File upload alerting system
Audit trail for S3 uploads
Monitoring data ingestion pipelines
Notification system for DevOps workflows


Design Summary

This architecture demonstrates a clean event driven pattern using AWS managed services.
It highlights serverless design, loose coupling, scalability, and automation.
The system is simple, efficient, and suitable for beginner to intermediate AWS and DevOps portfolios.
